# GlassEye-Renderer

My own implementation of a Vulkan renderer.

# Requirements

> \>= CMake 3.17 C++ 20 (project uses MSVC with CLion)

# Dependancies

Uses C++ 20. MSVC currently supports the most C++ 20 features out of all compilers

## All of these libraries are embedded into the project for stability

- ENTT
- GLM
- STBI (texture loading)
- Tiny Obj Loader (obj loading)
- GLFW
- Luna SDK (Vulkan)
- ImGui
